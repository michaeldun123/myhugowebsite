## Introduction
Hello, It's been a while.

I have not long started a new job with the local council and it has been an experience.

Today, has been a great day for me. Especially after a few days off leave, even though I was ill.

Got some great work done.

## About Monday (19/8/24)

This is my second week in, and its quite exciting, new fire panel, new files to scan plus, a secret rave haha

## About Tuesday (20/8/24)

Tuesday, same sort of stuff, nothing special, tested the new fire alarm again, but this time for a bit longer as needed to test it all worked.

## About Wednesday (21/8/24)

This day wasn't special again, but finally finsihed another box ready for the final box of the request. Finally got use of the big scanner for any big files that need scanning. Let's hope it keeps working for us.

## About Thursday (22/8/24)

Thursday was a lovely day. Nothing different from the work week. I enjoyed it muchly. The best day was the day after, Friday.

## About Friday (23/8/24)

Friday, the best day. Should of seen my face when I left work. Left at 4PM rather than 4:30PM. Again, slow but steady.

## Conclusion

This has been a slow but steady week. I don't know what I would do without the team behind me, and I enjoy where I am. I have had a lovely trainer, and got me straight upto speed with all the systems.
