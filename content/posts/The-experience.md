## Introduction

The experience for working with Hugo has been excelent, I can't fault it what so ever, and the way it is, can be so excelent.

As an example, this is the first time I'm using something like this and can't fault it what so ever.

## Final words

The experience of setting up ssh, using casaos (running off Ubuntu Server which is [linked](https://ubuntu.com/server)) as a base OS, then having to install Hugo. I found it nice and easy.

I would just like to say a big thank you to the Hugo team for making something like this and to keep up the good work.
